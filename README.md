# BMEN 509 Brain Segmentation Project

This is a school project for the class BMEN 509, which uses machine learning to perform segmentation of the human brain to detect tumors as well as the percentage of necrotic regions in those tumors. The project is based on the BraTS2020 dataset and requires you to download the dataset separately and place it in the `data/` folder.

## Dataset

The BraTS2020 dataset can be downloaded from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/brats20-dataset-training-validation/code?resource=download). After downloading the dataset, extract the files and place them in the `data/` folder.

## Requirements

To run the project, you will need the following libraries installed:

-   NumPy
-   Pandas
-   Matplotlib
-   Scikit-learn
-   TensorFlow
-   Keras

## Running the Project

To run the project, simply open the Jupyter notebook `brain_segmentation.ipynb` and follow the instructions. The notebook will guide you through the process of loading and preprocessing the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance.
